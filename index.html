    <p>Who Am I?</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>"Hi, I am Luke Manyamazi, an IT professional with a wealth of experience in remote and onsite technical support.
        Over the years, I've cultivated a deep passion for technology and programming,
        continuously expanding my skill set. I have completed several key courses,
        including the CS50P Python Course, which strengthened my understanding of
        problem-solving with Python, as well as FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification,
        which helped me master the basics of building accessible, user-friendly websites.
        I also completed CloudComputing 101 on Coursera, broadening my knowledge of cloud infrastructure and services.
        These experiences have provided me with a solid foundation in both software
        development and web technologies.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am a trainee at CodeYourFuture, where I am sharpening my coding skills
        through hands-on projects and collaborative learning.
        I am passionate about exploring new programming languages and technologies, and
        I look forward to applying my skills to build real-world solutions.
        Through my GitHub, I aim to share my learning journey and projects with the
        developer community, while continually improving and taking on new challenges."</p>
    <p>My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack software engineer, capable of developing robust,
        end-to-end applications that solve meaningful problems. I am committed to continuous
        learning and growth as I work towards this objective."</p>
